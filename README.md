# Kepler_Objects_of_Intrest_Exoplanet_Classification

## CS542 Machine Learning Project

This project explores the Kepler K1 from NASA to test machine learning models in the task of classifying between exoplanet potential candidates and false positives  
This project covers:
1. Exploring the dataset
2. Cleaning the data
3. Data scaling
4. Selecting which features to train on
5. Splitting the data
6. Using validation
7. Then testing models
